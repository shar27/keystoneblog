        <p>Broad knowledge of many fields of academia is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal – depending on circumstances. Advanced careers like medicine do not need multidisciplinary expertise but the vast majority of fields today do. With the rise of the gig economy, having expertise in various disciplines can not only provide job security, but also an alternative source of income for many people around the world. 

</p>
        <p>People can benefit from broad knowledge in many ways. High competition and rapid change in the market can mean job instability. This could lead to many employees being laid off and in search of new jobs. In a scenario like this, people can benefit greatly from having a good grip on various academic subjects. It grants people the fluidity required to navigate an unstable market. An engineer with a penchant for marketing can have many more job opportunities available to him than an engineer who only has expertise in his own field. 

</p>
        <p>Even beyond the instability of the market, job growth can also be largely attributed to employees having knowledge in multiple disciplines. An entry level employee who also has expertise in administration will see more job growth than someone who does not. I can see how a person who does not indulge in multiple disciplines can be locked down into one kind of role. Job growth means having additional responsibilities on top of your basic role, and this is something that is more likely to be granted to someone who actually does have the expertise to manage these additional responsibilities. </p>
        <p>In the end, I think that linear careers are becoming increasingly rarer in the current market and this means that having expertise in multiple disciplines is a necessary tool for survival in today’s world.
