        <p>Tour guides are locals trained specifically to guide and educate their travel groups on various cultural heritages and historical sites that they take their groups to see and explore. They plan out and time a whole explorative guide to whatever city you have come to learn about and discover. 

</p>
        <p>A tour guide may be helpful to the tourists that have never been in the respective area. When coming to a new city or country, people tend to feel out of place, and may or may not have any experience in dealing with the culture, language and attitude of people that live there. A tour guide will be extremely helpful in making sure the traveling persons do not get lost, feel out of place, or are misguided and scammed. Many visitors are specifically targeted by scammers as they make easy targets in an environment they know nothing about and may not even speak the national language. This happens commonly in train stations, taxis and even in booking rentals. More so, tourists are commonly overcharged for simple services by ticketing agents, taxis and merchants. A tour guide may ensure these things do not happen, or minimize the possibility of these happening.  

</p>
        <p>Tour guides are well versed in the locality of the region the travelers are visiting. Another benefit of having a tour guide is that the traveling persons will be with someone that speaks the language of the tourist destination, has experienced the local culture, food and homing services. Homestays are quite common and recommended with tour guides, and offer more of a real experience than living in a rented hotel. The idea behind traveling to a new destination is to experience the culture, authentic food and the local people wholly and without someone to guide the traveler properly, it is not always possible. 

</p>
        <p>Having someone familiar with you, - a tour guide â€“ may make the traveling experience more comfortable and safe. It may even allow you to make friends with the local tourist, as they will be by your side the whole time. As locals, tour guides will have insights to wonderful places that one would not find online, and may also save you your money from making disappointing and costly choices. I believe having a tour guide is a smarter option for tourists than not.
