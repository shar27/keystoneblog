        <p>Fiscal responsibility is an important part of adulthood in our capitalist society. It forms the crux of the day to day activities of an average citizen. From paying utility bills all the way to the purchase of luxury items like cars and smartphones, the ability to manage money plays a vital role in peopleâ€™s lives. 

</p>
        <p>The notion that children should learn to manage money at a young age seems sound given the pace at which the market is growing. More competition means less job opportunities and also less pay. I can see how managing money matters more now than ever. If children familiarize themselves with fiscal responsibility at a young age, they would avoid a lot of issues down the line. This is fairly straightforward  

</p>
        <p>But alternative view to this notion has more moral foundations than practical ones.  The growing competition in the market also means that adulthood would prove to be a very difficult journey to navigate as it is. The question now becomes whether or not it is wise to steal the carefree joy of childhood from kids to prepare them for what lies ahead. And to that end, I think it is not wise to burden children with the management of money at a young age. Is managing money a skill that one can only learn at a young age? 

</p>
        <p>In the end, I feel that the late teens are the perfect age to instill sound foundations of financial management in young adults. Children should not be burdened with the woes of adulthood especially when things are going to be hard for them later on anyways. The transition from teenage to adulthood is where things start to change anyways. These kids start choosing careers and applying to university at that age anyways, which makes it the appropriate age for teaching sound management of money.
