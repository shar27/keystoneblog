        <p>I believe advertisements are used to as a marketing strategy to create exaggerated images and opinions of products so that consumers will be more inclined to buy their product. There are numerous, reputable studies made on this topic alone that support my statement.  

</p>
        <p>The main goal of advertising is to reach more people and make more sales. There are many psychological studies that prove advertisements use tactics that will make you think you need their product to live a fulfilling life. An example of this is adverts that target children. While watching TV channels that are meant for children, advertisements in between may specifically focus on toys and games. These adverts will convince the child that they need this product for a happier and more sociable life. The adverts will contain bright colours, groups of children happily playing with said product, and price deals. These may also include short gameplays of whichever game is being advertised. These marketing strategies are designed to make children more likely to ask and pester their parents for the marketed product. There has been controversy against this form of marketing from parents. 

</p>
        <p>Another example of advertisements being exaggerated and harmful is for fast food companies. Images and videos of visually appealing food are used to make the targeted audience hungry and more likely to buy their products. This type of marketing is also targeted towards children and young adults. An example is McDonald's and their Happy Meal. It comes in different packaging and a toy to make the meal more appealing to children. The mascot of McDonalds is a happy, colourful clown that is famous for interacting and posing with children for pictures. There are Play Places in McDonalds to appeal more to parents and their children as well. These are all advertising strategies that make children and their parents more likely to stop by and buy a McDonald's meal.  

</p>
        <p>Food companies and their advertising strategies do not care about the effect they have on the general population. One of the biggest causes of obesity and heart problems relating to cholesterol in the US are due to fast food and its popularity. Exaggerated advertisement is direct correlation to this popularity. In present times, the emphasis on healthy eating has increased. The fast food industry counteracts this by offering salads and healthier options such as Keto or counted calories in their meals. This is to make sure they are still profiting off of their products. However, this makes people conscious about what they are consuming, so it directly results in unhealthy eating habits issues such as eating disorders. 

</p>
<p>
In conclusion, advertisements use various tactics that are sometimes unethical and exaggerated to sell products regardless of their products' actual value or effect to your life.
