        <p>There is only so much a person can learn limited within the confines of 1 geographical setting. While it is often said that people should be encouraged to travel more within their own country as opposed to going abroad I do not think that traveling within one’s own country is particularly beneficial to ones social development. 

</p>
        <p>Traveling inside of your own country means that you will only be interacting with people that you share a culture, language, and way of life with. One of the greatest benefits of traveling itself is that you get to learn more than you ever would inside your home. So while traveling in your own country is technically going outside of your home, it is not leaving your home in the truest sense of the word. For example, having travelled to almost 10 different countries, I have learned about ways of life that I would never have encountered in my homeland. 

</p>
        <p>Traveling abroad can be far more beneficial because you will interact with people who are almost polar opposites of you depending on where you go.  This will be a far better learning opportunity for you then talking into interacting with people who you share a culture with. A perfect example of this is when  I visited Japan. Not only is the culture different, but they way people think and interact is completely different to where I’m from. In my homeland, there is more focus placed on the success of an individual, whereas in Japan, I observed that that the well-being of the group was considered to be far more important. Had I only travelled within my country, I would never have learned of this different perspective. 

</p>
        <p>Traveling in your own country can instill a sense of national pride within you but it cannot do much more than that. Whereas traveling abroad can mean that you can have exposure to things that can inspire you and when you get back you’ll bring something more tangible than just pride. For this reason traveling abroad is better than traveling within your own country.
