        <p>The internet provides access to information that costs people money in the physical world. Easy access to such information has lead young people to become better in a multitude of ways that were not possible when the internet was not easily available or accessible to everyone.  

</p>
        <p>There are free, reliable resources on the internet that provide students education regardless of how much money they make, how much time they can give to their education, and regardless of who they are. The same cannot be said for most, if not all educational institutions. Khan academy is an incredible online resource that has helped a plethora of students and young adults succeed in their educational careers. YouTube is incredibly helpful in day to day problems that alot of people would have to pay to gain access to in the non virtual world. You can learn how to change a tire, learn to draw and animate from scratch, learn to garden, learn how to do basic and complex mathematics, how to make music on your own, and so much more all through free resources that are available on online platforms like YouTube and the internet.  

</p>
        <p>Certain generations of people, such as Millennials and Gen Z that are currently between the ages of 9-35 years of age, have lucked out when it comes to the internet. Gen Z has never been without internet, and is extremely reliant on it. Things like social media that are a very large part of the internet connect people throughout the world, more and more everyday. We had MySpace and Facebook to begin with, that allowed people from all over the world to connect with each other on a level that would not be possible without the internet. It gave a new meaning to socialising with people without physically being there with them. Online friends, online relationships and communities that are connected merely through the internet are examples of this. Social platforms like Skype and WhatsApp allow people to remain connected in real-time. 

</p>
        <p>The internet also allows people to be aware of what is going on in the world. Online activism is an example of this. You can find all sorts of websites that are created for the mere purpose of raising awareness about ongoing issues in the world. 

One cannot argue that the internet has modernised the way society works. Nowadays, most people cannot work or live a fulfilling life without an internet connect and a phone. Both of these things give them access to all of these free services. One can argue that the internet can be a hindrance to growth in young children with valid points. But I personally believe there are more benefits that we're gaining from the internet.
