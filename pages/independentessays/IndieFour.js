        <p>Advertisement and marketing are tools to induce customers towards a purchasing decision. An advert on TV goes a long way in building the brand image of a company and its products. In its purest form, advertisements aim to highlight the benefits of a product and companies go to great lengths to achieve this goal.  

</p>
        <p>This, however, is a very simplistic view of the advertisement process. There’s a lot that goes on behind the scenes. Deceptive marketing is often employed in commercial practice and can have many harmful effects towards the consumers. Whilst lawmakers regulate this to an extent, it is very possible for some things to slip through the cracks anyways. With sports companies hiring athletes to represent them and pharmaceuticals slipping in side effects in small font on screen, advertisements can range from relatively harmless to downright damaging. 

</p>
        <p>Add children watching television into this equation and the issue quickly turns from commercial deception into a full blown parenting disaster. Advertisement for products specifically targeted towards young and impressionable children can have horrible outcome for their upbringing. For example, advertisement for skincare products can instill insecurity in children especially due to the colorist themes present in many different cultures. 

</p>
        <p>Another problem which advertisement aimed towards children raises is that of classism. By marketing expensive toys to a wide audience, corporations can instill and unhealthy class insecurity within kids. There aren’t many easy ways to fix class insecurity but the least we can do is to not actively promote it through advertisements.  </p>
<p>
In the end, it is soft steps like banning advertisements targeted to children which can help fix some of the salient problems present in the world today. Large scale reform remains a possible option, but until such time it would help if we started regulating small things like these in order to tackle some of society’s widespread issues like colorism and classism. Inducing purchase is one thing, but for children the standards are different. I think that its best children are left to enjoy their childhood without fear of insecurity induced by television marketing.
