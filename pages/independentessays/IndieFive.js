        <p>The premise that technology is making children less and less creative is inherently flawed and stems from a lack of awareness about the virtual space which kids are increasingly occupying in this day and age. 

</p>
        <p>At its outset, it seems that children are less involved in physical activities than they were before. And the only way observers can notice children’s behavior is if they're out and about. So in the absence of physical activity, it is often assumed that because kids aren’t seen doing creative things physically, they are at risk of losing their creativity. This is a very short sighted assumption. 

</p>
        <p>Kids may not be overly involved in playing lego but that does not mean that they are not creating giant structures using their imagination in open world sandbox games like Minecraft. Similarly, kids may not want to use a sketchpad and paint to create art but you’ll often find them doing that on a tablet. The avenue of creativity may have changed but the creativity itself is evermore present.  Furthermore kids today have the option of monetizing their creativity online if they wish to do so in the future. So many of the skills that the kids are learning today in pursuit of creativity in a virtual environment, will later become avenues which they can use to earn a steady income. 

</p>
        <p>So in the end, while kids may not want to use their arms and their legs to exert creative output out in the world, if you pay attention you'll notice that they’re using their fingers to do the same.  

It is a disservice to a generation of young kids that adults aren’t paying attention to all the potential that these kids hold and how their hobbies while often viewed as damaging are healthy ones which can help secure a good future for them.
