        <p>Computer games are quickly growing out of their humble beginnings. From 2 simple dimensional  

Pixelated messes, to beautifully coded pieces of art. So in light of this recent computer game revolution, is it really proper to characterize computer games as a “waste of time”? I think not. 

 </p>
        <p>One of the primary concerns that parents have with respect to computer games and children is that they can often overstimulate their children and distract them from school. But with such advancements in computer technology, 
        this is a very reductionist perspective. The sheer variety of computer games available on the market 
        today means that parents can curate their children’s game library to be educational. In fact, many video games now include a world building sandbox component with them which can help be an avenue for children’s creative output. 

</p>
        <p>While I concede that children can often get caught up in their virtual world, parents can use parental control settings and create a gaming schedule for their children in order to combat excessive gaming. And if done right, this can be a great opportunity to teach kids discipline and routine. It has always been the job of parents to set the correct boundaries for their kids. Rather than seeing the computer gaming revolution as a threat to children’s development, parents should view this simply as an extension of regular parenting responsibility. 

</p>
        <p>Finally, it wouldn’t be fair to simply halt the development of gaming when it is quickly becoming a large and economically robust industry in today’s virtual world. Nowadays, there are computer game tournaments with rewards upwards of millions of dollars and e-sports as a whole is gaining widespread prominence and acceptance. 

</p>
        <p>Society has always had to adapt to changing trends and new technology. It would be far more beneficial to view computer games as simply another thing that humans will soon adapt to for their benefit rather than a threat.</p>
