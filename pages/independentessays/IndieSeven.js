        <p>Looking at how far humans have come in the past few decades, one thing that is definitely noticeable is the fact that humans are much more mobile now than they used to be in the past. This can partly be attributed to the development of the automotive industry and partly to the development of the communication industry. Planes can transport us halfway around the world in a matter of hours and phones can communicate messages in a matter of seconds. 

</p>
        <p> 

Common logic dictates that accessible mobility means that the population which would otherwise be confined to 1 area can now be dispersed over a wide region. And because of this nowadays many children choose to move out of their parents homes in pursuit of a new life elsewhere with new people. While children may maintain contact with their relatives over long distances, they form a kind of superficial relationship with these people. And when these children eventually get married and have their own kids, distance becomes a barrier that not only spans geography but also spans generations. 

 </p>
        <p>Changing trends which are spearheaded by development can often lead to a paradigm shift in culture. So where moving out of your parentsâ€™ home was an option made available by mobility, it can quickly change into a cultural practice with a couple of successive generations. Another factor which plays into the declining relevance of the extended family in the modern day and age has to do with how busy people are today as compared to how they were in the past., the more busy you are the less time you have to stay in touch with your extended family. 

</p>
        <p>So in the end, it is not entirely wrong to say that the extended family is quickly losing relevance in this day and age and that can rightly be attributed to the changing trends in transport, communication and also culture.
