<h5>Integrated Task</h5>

<p>The lecture discusses the new guidelines under which the situation regarding archeology in Britain has
changed drastically</p>
<p>Whereas the passage talks about many artifacts being lost to construction, low funding for archeology
and a general lack
of job opportunities in the field, the lecture speaks in light of the new guidelines
which provide for a framework where construction cannot begin unless a site has been properly
excavated by archeologists paid for by the construction company</p>
<p>This has
lead to increased job opportunities for archeologists which did not exist before. As a result of
this, the excavation of many more sites than were possible ever before. Archeologists are now hired to
catalogue and make reports on these sites. Previously un
damaged sites are preserved by making sure
that they are excavated or by building any new structures around an existing site of interest.</p>
