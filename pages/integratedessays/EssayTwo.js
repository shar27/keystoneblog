<h5>Integrated Task</h5>
<p>The lecture points out alternative facts which cast doubt on the authenticity of the the Jane Austen
painting, with respect to her being the
subject of the piece. The passage contends that since Austen’s
family has supported the veracity of the painting, it can be concluded that the painting was in fact that
of Jane Austen. The lecture opposes this view due to the fact that at the time during
which Austen’s
family gave permission of use of the painting, Austen had been dead for many decades. This means that
none of the family members present during the time that permission was granted, had ever seen Austen
in person.</p>

<p>The second aspect that the passage discusses regarding the authenticity of the painting has to do with
the fact that the face in the painting resembles the accepted amateur sketch of Austen. The lecture
argues that the resemblance is not concrete evidence of the claim that the per
son in the painting was
Austen. The painting could have been of a female relative of Austen which would also explain the
resemblance.</p>

<p>The last argument in support of the claim in the passage contends that the style of the painting can be
attributed to Ozi
as Humphrey, a painter who was active during the time that Austen was the age of the
subject of the painting. The lecture pokes holes in this argument by pointing out the fact that the canvas
on which the painting was painted was sold at a time where Auste
n was much older than the subject of
the painting.</p>
