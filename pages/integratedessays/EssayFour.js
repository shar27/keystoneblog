<p>The passage argues that the use of hydrogen based automobiles is far more efficient than the current
day internal combustion engine powered cars. The lecture re
sponds to this by affirming the assessmentof the inefficiency of the internal combustion engine highlighted in the passage. Then it goes on to
critique the passage’s optimistic suggestion that hydrogen based cars are the way forward</p>

<p>The passage points
out that hydrogen is readily available and can be obtained from water. The lecture
points out that while hydrogen may be present in water, the process of purification through which this
hydrogen can be obtained in liquid form is costly and uses a lot of en
ergy. This energy is obtained
through the same fossil fuel that is used to power the cars. The lecture goes on further to explain that
while the car itself would not produce harmful byproducts, the process through which hydrogen is
acquired would do it ins
tead. Further, the lecture also highlights the fact that hydrogen is very difficult
to store in liquid form which would make the whole process impractical and unfeasible. Lastly, the
lecture responds to the passage’s suggestion that hydrogen fuel is more e
conomically competitive by
illustrating the importance of platinum in the hydrogen based fuel cells. Platinum is an expensive metal
and would on the whole make the normalization of hydrogen cars costly.</p>
