<h5>Integrated Task</h5>
<p>The passag
e contends that private ownership of fossils can mean fewer opportunities for museums and
consequently, the general public to view these items. The lecture argues that private ownership can
mean that even an institution like a public school can now purcha
se a fossil easily if they wish to do so
for their students.</p>
<p>The passage also states that private ownership leads to less and less opportunities for scientists to
acquire and examine these fossils with propriety. The lecture however points out that for a
fossil to be
registered for a sale it first needs to be identified. And this process of identification is carried out by a
scientist after they have examined it properly</p>
<p>The lecture also states that while scientists and universities may not be able to
easily acquire fossils,
without private buyers not many fossils would be unearthed to begin with. This means that while
scientists may not have the appropriate opportunities to research these fossils due to private
ownership, they would not be able to get
their hands on them without private buyers anyways.</p>
