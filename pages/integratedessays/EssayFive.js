<h5>Integrated Task</h5>

<p>The lecture argues against many of the advantages of salvage logging presented in the passage</p>
<p>The lecture respond the passageâ€™s claim regarding environmen
tal benefits of salvage logging by arguing
that removing dead trees from the debris field right after a forest fire can leave the ground infertile
which can do great damage to the potential for new trees to grow in the area</p>
<p>Further, the lecture points o
ut the economic strain salvage logging can bring about as many of these
operations can only be conducted using heavy machinery which is very expensive. Also, the lecture
renders the argument about job creation moot by arguing that salvage logging jobs are
only temporary
and hence do not provide any job security</p>
<p>The passage contended that dead trees are a viable breeding ground for many insects which can do
great damage to the ecology of the forest itself. The lecture argues otherwise stating that many b
eetles
and insects have lived in Alaskan trees for a long time without doing much damage.</p>
