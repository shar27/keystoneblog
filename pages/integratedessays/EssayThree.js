<p>
The passage seeks to cast doubt on the accuracy with which the Chevalier has portrayed his life. The first
piece of evidence it provides for this is the fact that the Chevalier was known to have borrowed money
from a merchant which adduces to him having no
t been a wealthy man. The lecture responds to this by
pointing out that Chevalier’s wealth was locked down in assets which he had to sell in order to get
money. During this period, the lecture contends that the Chevalier might have borrowed funds until he
got his money
</p>

<p>
The passage also puts forth the argument that the Chevalier can’t have possibly remembered specific
phrases used in his conversations with the famous writer Voltaire. But the lecture responds to this by
pointing out that the Chevalier was
known to have done extensive journaling which he referred to when
writing about his encounters
</p>

<p>
The final argument that the passage proposes is that the Chevalier’s story about having escaped prison
through the ceiling seems exaggerated and it was likely
that he was released on a bribe. The lecture
makes reference to the ceiling of the Chevalier’s cell being repaired soon after his escape as evidence of
the fact that he did indeed escape through the ceiling.
