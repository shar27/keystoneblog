<h5>Integrated Task</h5>

<p>The passage argues that less and less young people are interested in reading literature today and that
this trend is damaging culture at large. It contends that people are instead turning towards forms of
entertainment that are less intellectually demandin
g than good literature. The public is missing out on a
great resource by turning away from literature because literature is good for the exercise of imagination
and equally good for the development of language</p>
<p>The passage also points towards the plight
of the authors which are creating good content but arenâ€™t
getting the reception that they deserve. As a result of this, literature is on its way out. The lecture
contends that while people may be less interested in reading literature today, it does not mea
n that
they are not consuming good content. People are watching good movies and listening to great music,
both of which can be intellectually stimulating.</p>
<p>The listen passage also states that a reason for the decline may be that the authors are simply wri
ting
content that is meant to be difficult to understand and hence it gets less reception, which is opposite to
the writers suggestion that the decline is due readers lacking good reading skills</p>
