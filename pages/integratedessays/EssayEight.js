<h5>Integrated Task</h5>

<p>The passage states that urban growth is bad for all birds as growing human populations move out and
take up more space that provided a natural environment for bird
s’ habitats. While true, the lecturer

argues that this is a sweeping statement and not entirely true. The lecturer makes a strong point that
while urban growth has effected some birds’ populations negatively, populations of pigeons and seagulls
have increa
sed due to food waste and landfills, and that even hawks and falcons have increased.
Therefore, this statement is not accurate.</p>
<p>The second point in the passage proposes that agricultural growth will increase and will result in further
destruction of bird
habitats and decline in bird populations. The lecturer rebuts this point, concurring
that while being correct about agricultural growth; it is not occurring the way the passage declares. The
lecturer states that less land is being used in the USA for agric
ulture every year; that increase in
agricultural production results from increasing varieties of crops. However, she states that these new
crops produce more food per unit of land, so less land is being used so there are lesser environmental
consequences</p>
<p>The third point the passage states is that as human settlements expand and agriculture grows, more
pesticides are being used. These pesticides are used to kill pests, but they get into the water and poison
it and the insects, which the birds eat. This re
sults in their deaths or infertility, resulting in lowering bird
populations. The passage also states that because agricultural growth is necessary, this will continue to
occur. The lecturer refutes all of these points by explaining that, while traditional
pesticides have been
destructive to birds, humans are more aware of the consequences of chemical pesticides now. And as a
result, new and less toxic pesticides are being formulated, and there is a growing trend to produce more
genetically altered crops th
at are pest resistant. These crops reduce the need for chemical pesticides
and do not harm birds as a result.</p>
